# 🧩 Challenge Description
Explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag. The application is a blog where one of the articles discusses API documentation. The goal is to find a file generated from the server’s memory that contains the flag.

A heap dump is a snapshot of a program’s memory (specifically, the heap section) at a particular point in time.
It typically contains:

## 📦 What’s Inside a Heap Dump?
Objects in memory: All the variables, strings, arrays, and data structures currently held.
References: Which object points to what (think of it like a web of connections).
Classes and metadata: Information about the type of each object.
Possibly sensitive data: Like passwords, tokens, flags (as you saw!), and session information.
## 🧠 Why Is It Useful?
For debugging memory leaks — you can see what’s not getting freed.
For performance analysis — spot which objects are hogging memory.
For security analysis — exposed heap dumps can reveal sensitive information.
# 🔍 Step-by-Step Solution

Clicking on the #API Documentation-link gives us the following information about the /heapdump endpoint

Access the endpoint
We can use curl to access the /headdump endoint
```

└─$ curl http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:55492/heapdump

```
Get the flag  
This returns A LOT of information so let's grep for the flag.
```

#  🧠  Conclusion of the Challenge
Developers accidentally exposed a heap dump on a live website.

You used your knowledge to discover the exposed endpoint and analyze the heapdump file.

You found a hidden flag inside the dump — proving that memory dumps must never be made public.

You learned how attackers could exploit misconfigured APIs or forgot


## 🧠 Key Takeaways
Aspect	What You Learned  
🔍 Reconnaissance	Explore the website fully, including hidden links like /api-docs/.  
⚙️ Swagger/API Docs	Swagger UI can unintentionally expose internal or debug endpoints.  
🧠 Heap Dump	A heap dump is a snapshot of server memory that can contain sensitive data such as flags, passwords, tokens, etc.  
🛠️ Command-Line Tools	Tools like curl, grep, and strings are powerful for finding valuable data in large responses.  
🚨 Security Flaws	Exposing debug tools like /heapdump in a live environment is a serious security vulnerability.
